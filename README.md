# Simple_Chess
A simple Chess Game for practicing Chess and Coding

This is a first attempt on a chess game, using fltk and an eviorment by Bjarne Stroustrup, introduced in his book "Programming Principles and Practice using C++".


Things to improve:

-Using Fl::redraw() causes the entire window to redraw, which looks ugly. This needs to look smoother.

-The figures look ugly, cause i suck at drawing. Even with ppen and paper...

-Maybe an ai could be added, one day...dream big.

-Multiplayer? Again, dream big :-)

-Overall, this is a lot of code, and it could be rewritten an made shorter next time.
